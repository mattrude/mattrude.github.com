  description: Is a small plugin that will display failed login attempts in your syslog or userlogins log file. Using this information <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/">Fail2Ban</a> will be able to block a user for a set amount of time. The best part, the block is happening at the IP level and blocks the IP address, not the user they are trying to log in as.
